# Kimdi Pack Opener
When i was 12 years old, my school was filled with soccer cards called Kimdi Football so i decidec to hop on the hype train and made this. i didnt know about databases so i literally used json files.

## Bussines Scheme
Each Kimdi pack was **17.500TMN** at the time and they contained 2 cards and 3 decoration stuff. i would sell the decorations for like **10.000TMN** or less to collectors and i made this website to sell the cards. this website uses algorithms (or i must call them basic if statements) to make sure we dont lose a single cent. we would sell each code for **7.000TMN** and each code would give 1 card but we also had plus codes that had "higher chances" of giving rare cards and we would sell them for **15.000TMN**
